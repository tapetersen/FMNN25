We've added several tests and they seem to work fine. We've tested on systems with known analytical solutions and we've tested on system where we've used assimulo and the LSODAR solver to generate a solution to check against. We managed to solve the pendulum case but we didn't have time to solve the truck case (it was put up rather late...)

They are compatible with nosetests and are located in test_integrators.
